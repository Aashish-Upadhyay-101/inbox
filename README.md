## :construction: Current Status

`UnInbox` is currently in Alpha Release. You can access it at [https://UnInbox.com](https://UnInbox.com)

Self-hosting is a WiP, currently not advised/supported, see below!

---

## 🤔 Why

Email is messy. You have an inbox that gets tons of random stuff dumped into. Reaching "Inbox Zero" is now as celebrated as running a marathon - thats sad.

Having a conversation over email has become impossible. It's slow, and when you go to check your messages, some random marketing email consumes your attention.

We're all used to chat, we like chat, its more personal - but its a far world away from email.

We bring email up to the modern standards and expectations of communication - block out all the noise, and let you converse without the cons.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

`UnInbox` is built with the following epic technologies & tools:

- [Nuxt JS (VueJS)](https://nuxt.com) FrontEnd & Backend + modules
- [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) Public API
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) CSS Engine (tailwind compatiable)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) Typesafe APIs
- [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) ORM + Postgres
- [Hanko.io](https://hanko.io/) User Authentication (PassKeys)

Things will change over time!

## 💾 Self Hosting

As we are in Alpha Release, a lot of things will keep changing rapidly and possibly dramatically.

We do not advise or support self hosting at the moment. But it's very high on our priority list.

We hope to have a fully documented self-hosting version available later in 2023.
