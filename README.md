## :construction: Current Status

`UnInbox` is currently in under heavy development. The initial public release is expected in October 2023

---

## About

Your communications should feel intuitive and natural, be calm and organized - but instead its overwhelming and painful.

UnInbox is built from the ground up as a communication infrastructure platform built for better communication.

Email is just a single of many possible connectors. Messages arrive and are go through a line of filtering, processing, and contexting before being delivered.

Key communication is at the forefront of your experience, and the noise is pushed to the back of the queue.

---

## Why

The first email was sent almost 45 years ago (1979), before the invention of the mobile telephone.

We've seen some advancements in email technology, but very few changes in the way we process and use them.

Inboxes have become a dumping ground for anyone to steal our attention and focus.

The defacto for personal conversations is now a chat app - why cant we have that same experience for email.

---

## Tech Stack

`UnInbox` is built with the following epic technologies & tools:

- [Nuxt JS (VueJS)](https://nuxt.com) FrontEnd & Backend + modules
- [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) Public API + Misc tooling
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) CSS Engine (fully tailwind compatible)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) Typesafe APIs
- [DrizzleORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) ORM + MySQL
- [Hanko.io](https://hanko.io/) User Authentication (PassKeys)

Things will change over time!

## Self Hosting

Self hosting will be possible, but requires some additional manual configuration for email. Please check out Discord community for information on how to self-host UnInbox
